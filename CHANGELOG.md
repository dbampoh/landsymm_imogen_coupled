# Changelog

All notable changes to the LandSyMM-IMOGEN coupled model framework
are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

For each release tag listed below, see `git log <tag>` for the per-step
commit history that produced it. The investigation evidence base is
preserved in `_phase2_findings/` and is **immutable across releases**
— it documents the predecessor framework trees (`version_A` and
`version_B`) at the moment the rebuild began.

## [Unreleased] — Rebuild in progress

In progress per `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` Part V steps 0-19. See
README.md "Roadmap" for the milestone schedule.

---

## [v0.1-skeleton] — 2026-05-05

### Added — initial repository scaffolding (step 0 of the rebuild plan)

- **Top-level files**:
  - `README.md` — top-level navigation, project overview, build/run
    placeholder, roadmap, citation pointers.
  - `LICENSE` — MIT, with reference to upstream component licences.
  - `CITATION.cff` — machine-readable citation metadata for the
    framework and its underlying peer-reviewed components.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` — development workflow, per-step verification
    discipline, three-remote push pattern, units-integrity
    discipline (six rules from `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` §I.D plus the
    reciprocal producer/consumer checks of §I.D.7).
  - `CHANGELOG.md` — this file.
  - `.gitignore` — comprehensive build artefact + run output +
    Python venv + IDE noise filtering, with allow-list overrides
    for per-subdir READMEs.
- **Top-level directory scaffolding** (12 dirs, each with a
  placeholder `README.md` to be expanded as the rebuild progresses):
  - `lpjguess/` — LPJ-GUESS LandSyMM fork (Phase 1 baseline:
    `trunk_r13078`; Phase 2 switchable backend: integrated LTS).
  - `imogen/` — Fortran IMOGEN with planned `ALLOCATABLE`-array
    refactor (Phase 1); C++ refactor brought to numerical parity
    in Phase 2.
  - `intermediary_py/` — Python `imogen_ghg_controller v0.1.0`
    (IPCC Tier-1 + RCMIP substitution).
  - `tools/` — cross-component utilities (the
    `imogen_inputs_to_lpjg_format.py` adapter,
    `cmip6_nc_to_cmip5_ascii.py` converter, regrid utilities).
  - `runs/` — per-scenario run setups
    (`runs/historic/` for the HILDA+ standalone Phase-1 with
    `save_state` at 2020; `runs/SSP1-2.6/`, `runs/SSP2-4.5/`,
    etc. for coupled scenario restart from 2020).
  - `data/` — small reference data (gridlists, soil map, etc.);
    large data documented in `data/DATA.md` for separate
    acquisition.
  - `scripts/` — `run_coupled.sh` (workstation),
    `run_coupled.sbatch` (cluster SLURM), `cluster/` (owl helpers).
  - `ci/` — CI/CD workflow definitions.
  - `docs/` — unified technical manual, scientific framework, build
    instructions, troubleshooting, glossary.
  - `paper/` — manuscript draft + figures + cited peer-reviewed PDFs.
  - `notes/` — per-step development notes
    (`notes/STEP_<n>.md` for each Part V step).
  - `archive/` — frozen legacy code preserved for reference
    (older C++ refactor before parity, retired Imogen-controller,
    legacy C++ Intermediary, etc.).

### Preserved — investigation evidence base (immutable)

- **`COUPLED_MODEL_INVESTIGATION.md`** (240 KB / 3 968 lines) —
  master investigation document covering: state of the system; the
  seven coupling break-points + bug C35 (`FILE_LPJG_FLUX`
  path-override); seven scientific framework lineages; system
  architecture (8 components plus auxiliaries); per-component deep
  dives drawing from the 8 subagent reports; full
  ~120-item bug catalogue with severity tags
  (🔴 active / 🟡 latent / 🟢 cosmetic); 11 documentation
  contradictions plus 4 doc-vs-code mismatches; A-vs-B divergence
  accounting; 24 open questions; 6-layer roadmap; recommended
  directory structure (which this scaffolding implements).
- **`EXECUTION_PLAN.md`** (142 KB / 2 595 lines) — operational
  checklist with: 12 settled strategic decisions (RCMIP backbone,
  Fortran-with-`ALLOCATABLE` first / C++ port second, `trunk_r13078`
  first / integrated LTS second, tight coupling default,
  incremental rebuild approach, units-integrity discipline,
  single codebase for workstation+cluster, Anaconda3 NetCDF
  preference, Stage I deferred-not-removed, save_state/restart
  LU strategy, Tmin/Tmax computation, Rh+W output asymmetry); item-
  by-item gap inventory (I.A code-level fixes, I.B 7 missing
  components, I.C data acquisition, I.D 7 units-integrity rules);
  11 strategic-decision write-ups; Part V formal step-by-step
  rebuild plan with verification milestones (steps 0-19, plus 9.5
  for climate-output enhancements; ~25-35 person-days to v1.0,
  ~7-10 weeks calendar); 5 implementation sketches in the appendix.
- **`_phase2_findings/`** (424 KB / 6 507 lines across 8 reports) —
  the canonical evidence base: documentation inventory, LPJ-GUESS
  `trunk_r13078`, Fortran IMOGEN, C++ IMOGEN refactor, C++
  Intermediary, Python Intermediary, GCM patterns + regrid
  utilities, run setups + orchestration + Data/. Cited inline
  throughout the master doc as `[SAn §x.y]`.

### Status

Scaffolding only. No build yet. The actual model code lands at
step 1 (LPJ-GUESS import) and onwards.

## [v0.0-investigation] — 2026-05-04

### Added — investigation phase (predecessor)

The investigation phase of this rebuild — performed entirely on the
predecessor framework trees `version_A/` and `version_B/` and the
two related projects `lpjg_landsymm_integration/` and `landsymm_py/`
— produced the three documents captured in the v0.1-skeleton
release:

- `COUPLED_MODEL_INVESTIGATION.md`
- `EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
- `_phase2_findings/01_documentation_inventory.md`
- `_phase2_findings/02_lpjguess_trunk_r13078.md`
- `_phase2_findings/03_imogen_fortran.md`
- `_phase2_findings/04_imogen_cxx.md`
- `_phase2_findings/05_intermediary_cpp.md`
- `_phase2_findings/06_intermediary_py.md`
- `_phase2_findings/07_patterns_and_regrid.md`
- `_phase2_findings/08_orchestration_and_data.md`

These document the state of `version_A` and `version_B` at the
investigation moment (4-5 May 2026) and serve as the immutable
evidence base for every claim in the rebuild plan.

The `version_A` and `version_B` framework trees themselves are
**not part of this repository** — they are preserved as read-only
reference at their original paths
(`/home/bampoh-d/Desktop/landsymm_lpjg/landsymm_mat/landsymm_lpjg_imogen_coupled_model/version_{A,B}/`)
and are not modified by this rebuild.
